# VRPTW Ant Colony Optimization

This project implements an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) solution for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). 
The provided scripts work together to initialize, run, and evaluate the ACO algorithm on VRPTW instances.

## Files Overview

- `ACO_main_script.py`: The main script to execute the ACO algorithm for VRPTW.
- `vrptw_base.py`: Contains the base classes and functions to define the VRPTW problem structure.
- `basic_aco.py`: Implements the fundamental Ant Colony Optimization logic.
- `ant.py`: Defines the behavior of individual ants in the ACO algorithm.
- `vprtw_aco_figure.py`: Handles visualization and plotting of results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

### Install Requirements


make sure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
```

## Running the Project

1. **Prepare the Environment**:
   Ensure all the files are in the same directory, or set up appropriate paths if the files are organized differently.

2. **Run the Main Script**:
   Execute `ACO_main_script.py` to start the ACO algorithm for the VRPTW.

   ```bash
   python ACO_main_script.py
   ```

3. **Review Output**:
   The script will generate console output showing the progression of the ACO algorithm. Additionally, it may save visualizations or data files depending on the settings in `vprtw_aco_figure.py`.

### File-Specific Details

- **ACO_main_script.py**: The entry point for running the ACO algorithm on VRPTW. Adjust any parameters directly in this file if needed before execution.
- **vrptw_base.py**: Contains classes and helper functions to define VRPTW instances, including customer locations, time windows, and route constraints.
- **basic_aco.py**: Implements the core logic of the ACO algorithm, including pheromone updating, ant movement, and solution evaluation.
- **ant.py**: Defines the ant behavior for exploring routes and updating pheromones.
- **vprtw_aco_figure.py**: Provides plotting functionality to visualize the VRPTW solution generated by the ACO algorithm.

### Configuring Parameters

To adjust parameters such as the number of ants, pheromone evaporation rate, or other hyperparameters, refer to `basic_aco.py` or `ACO_main_script.py`. 
Parameters are typically defined at the top of the file or within a dedicated configuration section.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure all required libraries are installed.
- Check file paths if running in a different directory setup.
- Verify Python version compatibility.
